Analyze the given database and provide insights to stakeholders.

Hello everyone, "Ever juggled with more than a million records? I have! Let's chat about the adventures in handling a colossal sea of data", from the resume project challenge#4 by @Codebasics.

Domain: Consumer Goods Function: Executive Management

Problem Statement:

Atliq Hardwares (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too.

However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, their data analytics director wanted to hire someone who is good at both tech and soft skills. Hence, he decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help him understand both the skills.

Task:

Imagine yourself as the applicant for this role and perform the following task

Check ‘ad-hoc-requests.pdf’ - there are 10 ad hoc requests for which the business needs insights.
You need to run a SQL query to answer these requests.
The target audience of this dashboard is top-level management - hence you need to create a presentation to show the insights.

MySQL Workbench (For getting insights using SQL)
Microsoft Excel (For data visualization)
Canva (For presentation)
Here are the top 3 things I learned in this project:

SQL syntaxes. The more SQL practice, the more we get better at it. I learned about the CTEs, window functions, and different ways to analytically check the results we have queried.
Queries to Visual Interpretation. The process to convert SQL queries to visual interpretation by means that can easily convey the insight.
Presentation skills.
